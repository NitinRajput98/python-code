# Python Pandas Merge Sort Filter

Visualizing data patterns often involves re-arrangement and elimination to determine patterns. For example, in a list of data with yearly rainfall amounts, 
to quickly determine the years with the most rainfall, the data can be sorted according to rainfall in descending order. A filter could be used to limit 
the amount of data observed, for example, to only show rainfall amounts greater than an inch. A merge can be used to join two datasets together, 
for example rainfall and temperature data from two different sources. The ability to sort, merge and filter data has always existed 
using SQL with database data, now it can be done in application memory space using Python.
