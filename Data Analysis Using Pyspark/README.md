# Data Analysis Using Pyspark

Here I am using Pyspark and google colab environment for applying different queries to the dataset to extract useful information out of it. Also, visualizing my query results using matplotlib.

# Methodology

* Apply some queries to this dataset to extract useful information out of it. We will start from simple queries and move to more advanced ones.

* Importing listening.csv file, which contains data related to different users listened to different songs and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and deleting null  values.

* Importing genre.csv file and merge it with listening.csv to answer more advanced queries

* Visualize our query results using matplotlib

# Data

The dataset used is related to Lastfm website which is an online music service where users can listen to different songs. This dataset is containing two csv files listening.csv and genre.csv.
